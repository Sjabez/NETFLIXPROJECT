<h1>NETFLIX RECCOMENDER PROJECT</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Customer behavior prediction lies at the heart of every modern business model — whether in stock trading, e-commerce, automotive design, or even political campaigns. Accurately anticipating user actions can drive growth, engagement, and strategic decision-making.

In the digital age, Recommendation Engines have become essential tools in this predictive ecosystem. These systems go beyond just analyzing past user activity — they proactively suggest content or products to increase user interaction, retention, and satisfaction.

From streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video to retail giants and content platforms, personalized recommendations are now critical. These engines analyze a user's history, preferences, and behavior to deliver content that aligns with their tastes.

For this project, we've built a Movie Recommendation System from the ground up using collaborative filtering (SVD). Each user receives tailored suggestions based on their movie ratings and patterns, allowing the system to recommend titles most likely to resonate with their preferences.

This step filters the dataset to identify which movies user 712664 has rated with 5 stars. These high-rated movies represent the user's explicit preferences and help in understanding their taste profile.
